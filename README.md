A powerful tool for automatically searching and downloading electronic component datasheets using Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs).

## Features

- üìù **Simple Input** - Provide a single MPN, a text file with multiple MPNs, or a CSV file
- üîç **Multi-Source Search** - Searches Google and direct manufacturer/distributor sites
- üß† **Intelligent Priority** - Prioritizes official manufacturer datasheets over third-party sources
- ‚úÖ **Datasheet Validation** - Validates PDF files to ensure they are actual datasheets
- ü§ñ **Browser Automation** - Uses Playwright for reliable web automation
- üîÑ **Batch Processing** - Process hundreds of components efficiently
- üìä **Detailed Logging** - Keeps track of all operations and errors

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management

### Install with Poetry

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datasheet-downloader.git
cd datasheet-downloader

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Install browser drivers
poetry run playwright install chromium
```

## Quick Start

### Download a single datasheet

```bash
poetry run datasheet-downloader LM358
```

### Download datasheets for multiple MPNs from a text file

```bash
poetry run datasheet-downloader -f data/mpns.txt -o ./datasheets/
```

### Process a CSV file with part numbers and URLs

```bash
poetry run datasheet-downloader --csv components.csv
```

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Options

```
usage: datasheet-downloader [-h] [-f FILE | --csv CSV] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [--no-headless]
                           [--direct-sources] [--list-only] [-v] [--debug]
                           [mpn]

Download datasheets for electronic components by MPN

positional arguments:
  mpn                   Manufacturer Part Number(s) to search for

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  File containing list of MPNs (one per line)
  --csv CSV             Process a CSV file with columns for part numbers and datasheet URLs
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Directory to save downloaded datasheets (default: current directory)
  --no-headless         Run browser in visible mode (not headless)
  --direct-sources      Skip Google search and only use direct manufacturer/distributor sources
  --list-only           List available datasheets but don't download them
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output
  --debug               Enable debug mode with even more verbose logging
```

### Working with a Text File of MPNs

Create a text file with one part number per line:

```
# data/mpns.txt
LM358
NCV8715SQ12T2G
ATmega328P
```

Then run:

```bash
poetry run datasheet-downloader -f data/mpns.txt -o ./datasheets/
```

### Working with a CSV File

The tool can process a CSV file with part numbers and optional datasheet URLs:

```csv
Part Number,Datasheet URL,MIME Type
LM358,https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm358.pdf,application/pdf
NCV8715SQ12T2G,,
```

Then run:

```bash
poetry run datasheet-downloader --csv path/to/components.csv
```

The tool will:
1. Use direct URLs when provided
2. Search for missing URLs
3. Update the CSV with download results

### List Available Datasheets Without Downloading

```bash
poetry run datasheet-downloader LM358 --list-only
```

### Use Only Manufacturer/Distributor Sites (Skip Google)

```bash
poetry run datasheet-downloader -f mpns.txt --direct-sources
```

## How It Works

Datasheet Downloader uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach:

1. **Search Strategy**:
   - First attempts a Google search with the query format `{part_number} datasheet filetype:pdf`
   - Falls back to manufacturer-specific searches if needed
   - Can search direct manufacturer/distributor sites as a last resort

2. **PDF Validation**:
   - Checks file size (50KB - 20MB)
   - Analyzes page count (3-200 pages)
   - Scans content for datasheet terminology
   - Filters out user manuals and catalogs

3. **Source Prioritization**:
   - Prioritizes PDFs from manufacturer domains
   - Follows with trusted distributor domains
   - Uses other sources as a last resort

## Supported Manufacturers

The tool has enhanced support for these manufacturers:

- Texas Instruments (TI)
- ON Semiconductor
- Analog Devices
- NXP Semiconductors
- STMicroelectronics
- Infineon Technologies
